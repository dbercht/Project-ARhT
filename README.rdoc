== Automated Relearning Hand Therapy (ARhT)

This project was developed as part of my Senior Design Project in the academic year of 2011-2012.

The premise of this initiative was to facilitate the process of going through physical therapy - we aimed, initially, for Hand Therapy.
Through the use of an Android Application and EMG sensors tied to a user's forearm, we could guide someone through a set of movements provided by a physical therapist and rate how they performed such movements.
This would allow patients to practice their therapy sessions at home while being monitored by a guiding application.
The results of such sessions are sent to this Rails applicaiton, which then provides therapists with a view of the client's therapy progress over time.
